# Class 15: Binary Tree and BST Implementation


## Approach & Efficiency
``PreOrder``, ``InOrder`` and ``PostOrder`` methods time complexity is O(n).<br>

``Add`` and ``Contains`` time complexity is also O(n).

1. ``PreOrder`` take a Tree and return a List ordered as Pre Order (Root Left Right).
2. ``InOrder`` take a Tree and return a List ordered as In Order (Left Root Right).
3. ``PostOrder`` take a Tree and return a List ordered as Post Order (Left Right Root).
4. ``Add`` take a Node and add it to a Binary Search Tree in the correct location.
5. ``Contains`` take a value and check if this value exist in the tree at least once or not.
