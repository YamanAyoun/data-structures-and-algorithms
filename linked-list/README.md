# Code Challenge 05: linked-list
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.



## Approach & Efficiency
Insert method time complixity is O(1)
Includes method time complixity is O(n)
ToString method time complixity is O(n)


## Solution
Create a Linked List class that contain three methods:

Insert : to Insert a new Node.
Includes : to see if the List include a Node with a specific value.
ToString : to Output the LinkedList.
